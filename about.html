    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This project is strongly inspired by <a href='https://twitter.com/Darsolo' target='_blank'>Darren Solomon's</a> fantastic project, <a href='http://inbflat.net/' target='_blank'>In Bb 2.0</a>. This modification of the project utilizes websockets to allow people to play instruments together in collaboration. To play an instrument, simply click on the image. To stop playing, click it again.</p>
